You will be provided with a CSV file containing student grades data. The dataset includes the following columns:


Student ID
Name
Math Grade
Science Grade

Tasks:
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Display the first few rows of the DataFrame to understand its structure.
Calculate and display the following statistics for each subject:
Mean (average) grade
Median grade
Maximum grade
Minimum grade
Visualize the distribution of grades for each subject using histograms.
Calculate the overall average grade for each student (average of all subjects) and add it as a new column to the DataFrame.
Identify the top 3 performing students based on their overall average grade.
Plot a bar chart to visualize the overall average grades of the top 3 performing students.
